# PasswordGenerator
This application takes user input (number of characters, and whether they would like to include numbers and symbols in their password) and generates a random password for them. Additionally, there is an option to copy the password for ease of use.
<h1>How to use</h1> 
<p>The user can begin by selecting the number of characters (between 12 and 128) that they would like their password to have. They can either manually type the number into the box, or use arrows to navigate between numbers. They can then choose to select the box for numbers and/ or the box for symbols. If neither box is selected, the password will only contain upper and lower case letters. The user can then hit the "Generate Password" button to get their random password. This button can be pressed as many times as the user would like. They may also hit the "Copy Password" button if they wish to copy the password to their clipboard, promtping an alert "Password has been copied!" </p>
